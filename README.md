# University Management System (RST)

A desktop-based **University Management System** developed as part of the **Database Systems course** at **Al-Ryada University for Science and Technology**.  
The system is designed to manage academic data and workflows efficiently through a structured, database-driven approach.


## Overview

This project simulates a real-world university system where different users interact with the database based on their roles.  
It focuses on **data organization, integrity, and secure access**, making it suitable for managing academic and administrative operations.


## Technologies

- **Python** – Application logic  
- **Tkinter** – Graphical User Interface  
- **SQL Server** – Database management  
- **SQL** – Queries, constraints, and relationships  


## System Roles

The application follows a **role-based access control** model:

- **Student:**  
  View profile, courses, grades, attendance, schedules, and submit assignments.

- **Doctor:**  
  Manage courses, attendance, student records, assignments, projects, and office hours.

- **Teaching Assistant:**  
  Assist with attendance tracking and academic activities.

- **Dean:**  
  Full access to system data, users, courses, and academic reports.


## Database Features

- Relational database design
- Proper use of **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**
- Normalized tables to avoid redundancy
- Secure and consistent data handling


## Key Objectives

- Apply database design concepts in a practical system
- Build a GUI application connected to a relational database
- Implement structured and organized academic workflows
- Strengthen understanding of SQL and database systems
